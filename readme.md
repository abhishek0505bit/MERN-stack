## Steps to Create an Express Server

 **Import Express**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```

## Mounting the Router on `/api/auth` Path

Mounting the router on the `/api/auth` path means that the routes defined in the router will be prefixed with `/api/auth`. This helps in organizing and structuring your application. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

### Example

- **Request to** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/` **will match the** `/` **route in the router and respond with** `"Auth home"`.
- **Request to** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login` **will match the** `/login` **route in the router and respond with** `"Login page"`.
- **Request to** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register` **will match the** `/register` **route in the router and respond with** `"Register page"`.

### More Details

Think of the base path as an address, and the routes in the router as specific rooms within a building at that address. When you mount the router, you specify the address, and all routes within the router are accessed through that address:

- **Address (Mounting Path)**: `/api/auth`
- **Rooms (Routes)**:
  - `/` -> `/api/auth/`
  - `/login` -> `/api/auth/login`
  - `/register` -> `/api/auth/register`

### Summary

Mounting the router on a path organizes your routes under a common base URL. It helps structure your application and makes it clear which routes belong to which parts of your application. In this example, all authentication-related routes are grouped under `/api/auth`.
