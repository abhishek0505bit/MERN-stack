## Steps to Create an Express Server

 **Import Express**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```

## Mounting the Router on `/api/auth` Path

Mounting the router on the `/api/auth` path means that the routes defined in the router will be prefixed with `/api/auth`. This helps in organizing and structuring your application. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

### Example

- **Request to** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/` **will match the** `/` **route in the router and respond with** `"Auth home"`.
- **Request to** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login` **will match the** `/login` **route in the router and respond with** `"Login page"`.
- **Request to** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register` **will match the** `/register` **route in the router and respond with** `"Register page"`.

### More Details

Think of the base path as an address, and the routes in the router as specific rooms within a building at that address. When you mount the router, you specify the address, and all routes within the router are accessed through that address:

- **Address (Mounting Path)**: `/api/auth`
- **Rooms (Routes)**:
  - `/` -> `/api/auth/`
  - `/login` -> `/api/auth/login`
  - `/register` -> `/api/auth/register`

### Summary

Mounting the router on a path organizes your routes under a common base URL. It helps structure your application and makes it clear which routes belong to which parts of your application. In this example, all authentication-related routes are grouped under `/api/auth`.

### express.json()
  `app.use(express.json())`: 
  - this line of code adds Express middleware that parses request bodies with json payloads.
  - Its important to place this before any routes that needed to handle json data in the request body.
  - The middleware is responsible for parsing json data from requests, and it should be applied at the beginning of your middleware stack to ensure its availability for all subsequent route handlers.
